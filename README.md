# The Swift Programming Language

## Topics

### Language Guide

[The Basics](the-basics.md) - Work with common kinds of data and write basic syntax.

[Basic Operators](basic-operators.md) - Perform operations like assignment, arithmetic, and comparison.

[Strings and Characters](strings-and-characters.md) - Store and manipulate text.

[Collection Types](collection-types.md) - Organize data using arrays, sets, and dictionaries.

[Control Flow](control-flow.md) - Structure code with branches, loops, and early exits.

[Functions](functions.md) - Define and call functions, label their arguments, and use their return values.

[Closures](closures.md) - Group code that executes together, without creating a named function.

[Enumerations](enumerations.md) - Model custom types that define a list of possible values.

[Structures and Classes](structures-and-classes.md) - Model custom types that encapsulate data.

[Properties](properties.md) - Access stored and computed values that are part of an instance or type.

[Methods](methods.md) - Define and call functions that are part of an instance or type.

[Subscripts](subscripts.md) - Access the elements of a collection.

[Inheritance](inheritance.md) - Subclass to add or override functionality.

[Initialization](initialization.md) - Set the initial values for a type’s stored properties and perform one-time setup.

[Deinitialization](deinitialization.md) - Release resources that require custom cleanup.

[Optional Chaining](optional-chaining.md) - Access members of an optional value without unwrapping.

[Error Handling](error-handling.md) - Respond to and recover from errors.

[Concurrency](concurrency.md) - Perform asynchronous operations.

[Type Casting](type-casting.md) - Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.

[Nested Types](nested-types.md) - Define types inside the scope of another type.

[Extensions](extensions.md) - Add functionality to an existing type.

[Protocols](protocols.md) - Define requirements that conforming types must implement.

[Generics](generics.md) - Write code that works for multiple types and specify requirements for those types.

[Opaque Types](opaque-types.md) - Hide implementation details about a value’s type.

[Automatic Reference Counting](automatic-reference-counting.md) - Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.

[Memory Safety](memory-safety.md) - Structure your code to avoid conflicts when accessing memory.

[Access Control](access-control.md) - Manage the visibility of code by declaration, file, and module.

[Advanced Operators](advanced-operators.md) - Define custom operators, perform bitwise operations, and use builder syntax.
