# The Swift Programming Language

## Topics

### Language Guide

[The Basics](<The Basics.md>) - Work with common kinds of data and write basic syntax.

[Basic Operators](<Basic Operators.md>) = Perform operations like assignment, arithmetic, and comparison.

[Strings and Characters](<Strings and Characters.md>) - Store and manipulate text.

[Collection Types](<Collection Types.md>) - Organize data using arrays, sets, and dictionaries.

[Control Flow](<Control Flow.md>) - Structure code with branches, loops, and early exits.

[Functions](Functions.md) - Define and call functions, label their arguments, and use their return values.

[Closures](Closures.md) - Group code that executes together, without creating a named function.

[Enumerations](Enumerations.md) - Model custom types that define a list of possible values.

[Structures and Classes](<Structures and Classes.md>) - Model custom types that encapsulate data.

[Properties](Properties.md) - Access stored and computed values that are part of an instance or type.

[Methods](Methods.md) - Define and call functions that are part of an instance or type.

[Subscripts](Subscripts.md) - Access the elements of a collection.

[Inheritance](Inheritance.md) - Subclass to add or override functionality.

[Initialization](Initialization.md) - Set the initial values for a type’s stored properties and perform one-time setup.

[Deinitialization](Deinitialization.md) - Release resources that require custom cleanup.

[Optional Chaining](<Optional Chaining.md>) - Access members of an optional value without unwrapping.

[Error Handling](<Error Handling.md>) - Respond to and recover from errors.

[Concurrency](Concurrency.md) - Perform asynchronous operations.

[Type Casting](<Type Casting.md>) - Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.

[Nested Types](<Nested Types.md>) - Define types inside the scope of another type.

[Extensions](Extensions.md) - Add functionality to an existing type.

[Protocols](Protocols.md) - Define requirements that conforming types must implement.

[Generics](Generics.md) - Write code that works for multiple types and specify requirements for those types.

[Opaque Types](<Opaque Types.md>) - Hide implementation details about a value’s type.

[Automatic Reference Counting](<Automatic Reference Counting.md>) - Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.

[Memory Safety](<Memory Safety.md>) - Structure your code to avoid conflicts when accessing memory.

[Access Control](<README (1).md>) - Manage the visibility of code by declaration, file, and module.

[Advanced Operators](<Advanced Operators.md>) - Define custom operators, perform bitwise operations, and use builder syntax.
